title:<Genomic-study-for-maternal-related-traits-in-Santa-Inês-sheep-breed>
date: 2018
publication_types:2
publication: Livestock Science
abstract: The aim of this study was to estimate variance components and to identify genomic regions and pathways associated with maternal related traits in Santa Inês sheep breed adapted to tropical climate. Phenotypic records for maternal efficiency (ME), metabolic maternal efficiency (MME), twin lambing (TL), adult weight (AW), metabolic adult weight (MAW), and body condition score (BCS) from 1333 ewes from Santa Inês breed were used. A total of 576 animals were genotyped with the Ovine SNP12k BeadChip (Illumina, Inc.), that contains 12,785 bialleleic SNP markers. The variance components were estimated using a single trait animal model by single step genomic BLUP procedure. For AW, MAW, BCS, ME, MME and TL the mean values were 50.30 (±9.76), 19.2 (±2.33), 2.76 (±0.72), 34.6 (±15.95), 91.8 (±42.52), and 1.27 (±0.44), respectively. The heritabilities estimated were moderate for AW (0.32) and MAW (0.33) and low for BCS (0.04), ME (0.07), MME (0.08), and TL (0.10). A total of 7, 8, 13, 16, 19, and 09 candidate regions for ME, MME, TL, AW, MAW and BCS traits were identified, respectively. AW and MAW had a total of 15 regions in common, while AW and BCS had a common region on chromosome 21. ME and MME had six candidate regions in common, and TL had no common regions with any other features. The maternal indicator traits have genetic variability to respond to selection in Santa Inês breed, and it would be expected higher genetic gain for ewe adult weight when compared to the others studied traits. Several candidate regions related to growth, reproduction, lactation and enviromental adaptability were identified in this study. These candidate regions would give support to identify and select animals with higher maternal efficiency and fitness, and consequently, increase the productivity of Santa Inês sheep. Moreover, the results of this study should help to understand the genetic and physiologic mechanism associated with maternal related traits in Santa Inês breed.

title:<Genetic-association-between-different-criteria-to-define-sexual-precocious-heifers-with growth,-carcass,-reproductive-and-feed-efficiency-indicator-traits-in Nellore-cattle-using-genomic-information
date: 2018
publication_types:2
publication: Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics
abstract:The aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for different precocious calving criteria and their relationship with reproductive, growth, carcass and feed efficiency in Nellore cattle using the single‐step genomic BLUP. The reproductive traits used were probability of precocious calving (PPC) at 24 (PPC24), 26 (PPC26), 28 (PPC28) and 30 (PPC30) months of age, stayability (STAY) and scrotal circumference at 455 days of age (SC455). Growth traits such as weights at 240 (W240) and 455 (W455) days of age and adult weight (AW) were used. Rib eye area (REA), subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT), rump fat thickness (RFT) and residual feed intake (RFI) were included in the analyses. The estimation of genetic parameters was performed using a bi‐trait threshold model including genomic information in a single‐step approach. Heritability for PPC traits was moderate to high (0.29–0.56) with highest estimates for PPC24 (0.56) and PPC26 (0.50). Genetic correlation estimates between PPC and STAY weakened as a function of calving age. Correlation with SC455, growth and carcass traits were low (0.25–0.31; −0.22 to 0.04; −0.09 to 0.18, respectively), the same occurs with RFI (−0.09 to 0.08), this suggests independence between female sexual precocity and feed efficiency traits. The results of this study encourage the use of PPC traits in Nellore cattle because the selection for such trait would not have a negative impact on reproductive, growth, carcass and feed efficiency indicator traits. Stayability for sexual precocious heifers (PPC24 and PPC26) must be redefined to avoid incorrectly phenotype assignment.

title:<Genome‐wide-scan-for-runs-of-homozygosity-in-the-composite-Montana-Tropical®-beef-cattle>
date: 2019
publication_types:2
publication: Journal of Animal Breeding and Genetics
abstract:The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of runs of homozygosity (ROH) and autozygosity islands in the composite Montana Tropical® beef cattle to explore hotspot regions which could better characterize the different biological types within the composite breed. Montana animals (n = 1,436) were genotyped with the GGP‐LD BeadChip (~30,000 markers). ROH was identified in every individual using the plink v1.90 software. Medium and long ROH prevailed in the genome, which accounted for approximately 74% of all ROH detected. On an average, 2.0% of the genome was within ROH, agreeing with the pedigree‐based inbreeding coefficient. The Montana cattle with a higher proportion of productive breed types showed the highest number of autozygosity islands (n = 17), followed by those with a higher proportion of breeds adapted to tropical environments (n = 15). Enriched terms (p < .05) associated with the immune and inflammatory response, homeostasis, reproduction, mineral absorption, and lipid metabolism were described within the autozygosity islands. In this regard, over‐represented GO terms and KEGG pathways described in this population may play a key role in providing information to explore the genetic and biological mechanisms together with the genomic regions underlying each biological type that favoured their optimal performance ability in tropical and subtropical regions.

title:<Evaluation-of-selection-criteria-in-laying-quail-(Coturnix-coturnix-japonica)>
date: 2019
publication_types:2
publication: Livestock Research for Rural Development
abstract:The primary aim of the commercial exploration of quail in Brazil is to increase egg production. The characteristics of the genetic groups used are not well known, making it difficult to increase eggs production. The objective of this study is to evaluate selection criteria to increase the number of eggs produced in two lineage of laying quail. In this sense, genetic parameters were estimated and calculated the indirect and direct responses to selection. The genetic gain was calculated based on the selection of partial production in the complete egg production. The indirect response showed to be more efficient in terms of genetic gain compared to the direct selection, indicating that the use of the first 60 days is the ideal period for selection of quail, providing satisfactory gain in egg production compared to the total production period. The use of this period allowed the early identification of superior individuals, increased the total egg production and the genetic gain, reducing the generation interval and making it possible to carry outtwo selections per year.
